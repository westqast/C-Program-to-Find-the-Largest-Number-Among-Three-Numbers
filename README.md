C Program to Find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers


Hello people.
This project is about finding the largest number among three numbers which are integers.
It is a training project where I want to learn about varuables , the 'if'... else Statement,
logical operators and comments.
The program is written in C and I used CodeBlocks.
